## Overview

InvoiceGen is a modern privacy-focused application that reimagines how businesses create professional invoices. At its core, InvoiceGen is built around the concept of local processing - ensuring all invoice generation happens in your browser while keeping your business data completely private and secure.

## The InvoiceGen Experience

InvoiceGen transforms invoice creation through local browser processing - ensuring your business data never leaves your device. Users input company details, client information, and itemized charges, then customize the invoice with brand colors, logos, and professional styling. The real-time preview shows exactly how the final invoice will look, and high-quality PDF generation ensures professional output for any business need. The responsive design adapts seamlessly to any device, making invoice creation possible anywhere.

## Why InvoiceGen?

InvoiceGen combines the best of professional invoicing, privacy protection, and modern web design into one seamless experience. Whether you're a freelancer creating invoices for clients, a small business managing billing, or a consultant tracking project costs, InvoiceGen provides the tools and platform to make it happen.
