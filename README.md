## Overview

InvoiceGen is a modern privacy-focused application that reimagines how businesses create professional invoices. At its core, InvoiceGen is built around the concept of local processing - ensuring all invoice generation happens in your browser while keeping your business data completely private and secure.

## The InvoiceGen Experience

InvoiceGen transforms invoice creation through local browser processing - ensuring your business data never leaves your device. Users input company details, client information, and itemized charges, then customize the invoice with brand colors, logos, and professional styling. The real-time preview shows exactly how the final invoice will look, and high-quality PDF generation ensures professional output for any business need. The responsive design adapts seamlessly to any device, making invoice creation possible anywhere.

## Why InvoiceGen?

InvoiceGen combines the best of professional invoicing, privacy protection, and modern web design into one seamless experience. Whether you're a freelancer creating invoices for clients, a small business managing billing, or a consultant tracking project costs, InvoiceGen provides the tools and platform to make it happen.

Built with modern web technologies and designed for privacy, InvoiceGen offers a responsive, accessible, and beautiful experience across all devices.



## Privacy & Security

Your privacy is our top priority. All processing happens locally in your browser, ensuring your business data never leaves your device. No data is sent to external servers, and no account registration is required. Your invoice information, client details, and business data remain completely private and secure throughout the entire creation process.
